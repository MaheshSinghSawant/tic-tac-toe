// the function that checks if there is a winner in the grid
// the logic is as follows:

// We know which row and col were changed by the click and they are available as input args
// 1. check if all cells in same row are of the same value, if so that value wins
// 2. check if all cells in same column are of the same value, if so that value wins
// 3. check diagonal and reverse diagonals for same value and if so, that value wins
